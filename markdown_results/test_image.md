This image is a photograph or digital illustration of a woman showcasing a stunning strapless wedding dress. The strapless, lace and decorated "mermaid" dress features a sweetheart neckline and a breathtakingly long, skirt with multiple layers of ruffled chiffon at the bottom, which creates a diffused shadow effect while flying away behind the visible portion, creating an elegant yet laid-back bridal look. The dress is rendered in a soft white hue.

The woman, with dark hair and red lips, wears these earrings in a pear jumbo silhouette with a teardrop diamond design covered in white rays. She is in profile, looking to her left with a loose updo and flowing hair blowing in the wind. Her position is likely manipulated, including likely raising the brushing angle with upward body weight. The image is set against a serene gradient background that transitions from light blue to white in the center, creating a peaceful and ethereal atmosphere.
